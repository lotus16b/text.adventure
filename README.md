***Learning Python & Text Adventure***

This is an attempt to learn Python through the creation of a text adventure. I will start with a basic understanding of Python using the test.py file or derivative of.

This is an iterative process and as such the coding methods will change as I learn more. Main.py will serve as my initial text adventure file until I develop more Python knowledge and better understand how to structure such a game. I would prefer to build a replicatable structure so I could write another text adventure inserting the new locations, items, and story line into the existing "engine".
